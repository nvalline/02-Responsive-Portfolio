## Description

For this project I created a simple, responsive portfolio design to showcase; who I am, my projects and a way to contact me. I began by developing the index.html page utilizing the Bootstrap 4 framework. Once created I was able to copy the repeating elements to the portfolio.html and contact.html files. This created continuity between the pages.

This was also designed as a responsive website that will adjust to different device widths is a clean and purposeful manner.

#### Technologies
